<h3>MR. AND MRS. BOWSER.</h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<h3>The Former Decides to Give a Progressive Euchre
Party.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Mr. Bowser suddenly looked up from his paper the other evening
and asked:</p>

<p>"Why is it that we haven't given a progressive euchre party
this season?"</p>

<p>"They have been voted too much trouble," I replied.</p>

<p>"They have, eh? Did any one vote besides you? I saw half
a dozen mentioned in the papers last Sunday."</p>

<p>"It's almost impossible to get thirty or forty people together
on a certain evening, even if all desire to come. Mrs. Johnson
calculated on eight tables and only had enough for five. Mrs.
Dart calculated on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh! What does a woman's calculation amount to?"</p>

<p>"But if people can't come and don't come, what are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>"They can come, and they will come. It's all in the management."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd try it."</p>

<p>"Do you? Very well, Mrs. Bowser; I shall give a progressive
euchre party next week, Wednesday evening. If you'll see
to the refreshments I'll see to the people."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to, of course, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"You must prepare yourself for disappointments."</p>

<p>"Oh, I must! How kind of you to give me warning! Mrs.
Bowser, I don't want to seem vain or egotistical, but I'll invite
thirty-six people here on that night, and for every one who fails
to come I'll give you a $20 bill."</p>

<p>"You are very kind&mdash;very kind. I hope the party, will be a
great success. You can begin at once."</p>

<p>During the next hour he had the use of the telephone to call up
acquaintances, and when he finally hung up the trumpet he
turned to me with:</p>

<p>"Anything very dismal about that, Mrs. Bowser? I've got
ten couple without moving out of my tracks. I'll have the other
eight before to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"That is, they will promise to come."</p>

<p>"Promise! Promise! Do you imagine that all other people
are like you? Most folks know their own minds for a day or
two ahead, Mrs. Bowser."</p>

<p>When he came home next night he had a list of eighteen couples
who had been invited and solemnly promised to come. Mr.
Bowser had made it a point to inform each one that the playing
would begin at eight sharp, and all had agreed to be on hand
fifteen minutes before that hour.</p>

<p>"Voted too much trouble&mdash;can't get people enough!" sneered
Mr. Bowser as he looked over the list. "It's in the management,
Mrs. Bowser&mdash;all in the management."</p>

<p>For three days he walked around on tiptoe and took every occasion
to brag over me. Then came the first setback. We were
at dinner when the telephone rang and Mr. Bowser was asked
for.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bowser."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is Filbert."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you that we can't come down to the party."</p>

<p>"You can't?"</p>

<p>"No. My wife has just remembered that she agreed to go
over to Johnson's on that night. Sorry, old fellow, but I
hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser shut him off with a loud bang and returned to me
and said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser, don't you ever darken Filbert's doors again&mdash;never!
They are liars and dangerous people. I can fill their
places in five minutes."</p>

<p>Before he got out of the house there was another ring.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bowser!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is Watkins."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When I told you the other day we'd be down Wednesday
evening, I forgot that our Eva was to have a child's party on the
same evening. That knocks us out."</p>

<p>"And you can't come?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Sorry to disappoint you, old fellow, but of
course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Watkins is a liar, Mrs. Bowser&mdash;a first class, bold-faced liar!"
exclaimed Mr. Bowser, "and you want to cut the whole family as
dead as a door nail!"</p>

<p>He went off saying he could get 2,000,000 couples to take
their places, and he returned at evening just as the following
note came by the hands of a messenger boy:</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Jackson present their compliments, and regret
that the death of an uncle in China will prevent them from being
present on Wednesday evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser had begun to turn white when the telephone rang.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bowser!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Say, old man, this is a world of change, you know. When
I told you we'd come down to that party I never thought about
my sister. She's to be married that same evening. Tra-la, old
boy; hope you'll have a good time."</p>

<p>"I told you it would be hard work to get so many people
out," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Did you, Mrs. Bowser? How kind of you! But I'll show
you and these liars and deceivers a thing or two before I get
through."</p>

<p>There were no more declinations until Wednesday morning.
Then Mr. Bowser was called up by telephone.</p>

<p>"That you, Bowser?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it to-night you have that party?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I thought it was a week from to-night! Well,
that knocks us out. We've got to go to the Y. M. C. A. Sorry,
you know, but this is a previous engagement."</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser was jumping up and down when there came
another ring.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bowser!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nice weather."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All well down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Say, Bowser, my wife made a previous engagement for to-night.
We've got to go to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser shut him off with a bang and started for the
office. During the forenoon I took in two more declinations,
and while he was at dinner there was a ring and the old familiar
hail:</p>

<p>"Hello, Bowser!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Say, Bowser!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We expect to be down early to-night."</p>

<p>"Glad of it."</p>

<p>"But it may be that my mother-in-law will come in on the
6.30 train. If she does we can't come."</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser seemed dazed as he hung up the trumpet and left
the house. The last blow came at 7 in the evening. The telephone
rang and he crawled over to answer.</p>

<p>"Is this Bowser's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where's the old man?"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Bowser."</p>

<p>"Oh! so you are. Your voice seems mighty weak to-night.
Say, old man, the three couples of us in this terrace were coming
down to-night, but we must disappoint you at this late moment.
We have had free tickets sent up for the opera, and of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser walked to the front door, locked it, muffled the
bell and turned out the gas. Then he sat down and was very
quiet for a couple of hours. At last he looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser, some husbands would murder a wife for this!"</p>

<p>"But what have I done?"</p>

<p>"What have you done? Coaxed, bribed and bulldozed me
into giving a progressive euchre party, and where's the party?
I told you how it would come out, and here we are! Mrs. Bowser,
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was too full for further utterance, and went to bed.</p>

<h3>The Wonderful Case of the Mullenhausers, Who
Bathed at Coney Island.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />


<p>The familiar figures of Mr. Germain Mullenhauser and his wife
are no longer seen daily braving the surf at Coney Island. They
have returned to their Brooklyn residence, where their ablutions
are made in the bath tub, and it is very doubtful whether any of
the seaside resorts will ever see them again. An estrangement
has grown up between them, and they are not happy.</p>

<p>Their story is a strange eventful history. Two months ago
Mrs. Mullenhauser could readily turn the scales at 210 pounds,
while her husband weighed about the ninety pounds necessary to
aggregate 300. They were proud of their proportions, viewed
collectively, and neither was jealous of the other. But in an evil
hour a friend told Mr. Mullenhauser that he was beginning to look
like a scarecrow, and slightingly nicknamed him "Praise-God
Bare-Bones," in pointed and scornful recognition of the office of
deacon in a Brooklyn church. Mr. Mullenhauser consulted a
doctor with the view of gaining flesh.</p>

<p>About the same time an attenuated female acquaintance told
Mrs. Mullenhauser that if she grew any fatter she would stand a
chance of bursting, and would certainly become dropsical. The
stout lady was alarmed, and she too, sought the advice of a medical
practitioner relative to the best method of shedding some of
her superfluous tissue. Neither husband or wife cared to take
counsel with the family physician. They stated their cases to
different doctors, and only told each other what they had done
when their courses had been mapped out for them.</p>

<p>"Dr. Jones seems to be a very intelligent person," said the
lady. "He says that by surf bathing I can reduce my weight at
the rate of fourteen pounds a week."</p>

<p>"Why, he must be an imbecile," exclaimed her husband, hotly.
"If you go wallowing, like a whale, in the ocean it will add just
two pounds a day to your bulk. That is what Dr. Brown promises
that sea bathing will do for me, and I am going to begin to
try it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Germain, you have been imposed upon by an ignorant
quack," replied Mrs. Mullenhauser, severely. "If you risk your
light body in those great rollers at Coney Island you will be swept
away. Be contented with your small proportions and try to show
that you make up in mind what you lack in matter."</p>

<p>"I won't," cried the small man, angrily. "I'll take Dr.
Brown's advice, and I'll soon be as fat as you are now. Though
Lord knows what size you'll be then, if you follow the directions
of that ass, Jones," he added sarcastically.</p>

<p>Thus was made between them the fissure that has since been
widening daily. They went down to Coney Island together and
engaged board and lodging. They kept up a show of friendliness
before the public to save appearances, but they ate their
meals in silence and bathed at different parts of the beach.</p>

<p>The other frequenters looked at them with amazement, for a
great change was soon perceptible in each. Drs. Brown and
Jones were both right. At the end of sixty days their joint
weight was still 300 pounds, but Mr. Mullenhauser now tipped
the scales at 210 pounds and was threatened with dropsy, while his
wife could only turn them at 90 pounds, looked like a scarecrow,
and feared to breast the waves, as she had formerly done, lest
they should sweep her away.</p>

<p>They fled by different trains from the seaside and tried to consult
the slighted family physician, but he refused to be consulted,
and advised them, cynically, to see Drs. Jones and Brown. Mrs.
Mullenhauser is half a foot taller than her spouse, and much better
adapted, anatomically, to carry the heavier burden of flesh.
She looks like a greyhound, and he like a puncheon standing on
its end. It is likely that before the bathing season returns, Brown,
the ignorant quack, will prescribe for the lady, and Jones, the
ass, for her husband.</p>

<h3>She Knew One When She Saw It.</h3>

<p>The following is related as an actual occurrence during the
presentation of "Virginius" by the amateurs of Macon. Those
who have seen the play will doubtless remember the scene where
the ashes of Virginia, who has been killed by her father, after
which the body was cremated, are brought on the stage in an urn.
A young lady in the audience turned to her escort with the remark:
"That's a crematory."</p>

<p>"No," said he, "you are mistaken; that is not a crematory."</p>

<p>"Well, I say it is," she remarked; "I guess I know a crematory
when I see one."</p>

<h3>THE LIMEKILN CLUB.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>How Major Drawbar Jones Escaped Expulsion on
Serious Charges.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>On the opening of the meeting the secretary announced a communication
from Eufaula, Ala., making charges against Major
Drawbar Jones, an honorary member of the club. He was
charged with:</p>

<p>1. Going on a rabbit hunt while his wife lay at the point of
death.</p>

<p>2. Putting burrs under the saddle of his old mule to get up an
artificial enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Brother Gardner said that it was a question for debate, and
Giveadam Jones arose and observed that he could never vote to
convict a brother on the first charge. While there might be no
question that Major Jones went out to hunt rabbits while his wife
was dying, what was his object? Was it for amusement, or was
it to provide her with rabbit soup? The accused should be given
the benefit of the doubt. As to charge No. 2, that was a different
matter. A man who would put burrs under his saddle,
whether that saddle was on a horse or a mule, deserved the severest
condemnation.</p>

<p>Waydown Bebee couldn't excuse the Major for going on that
rabbit hunt. A dying wife does not care for soup of any sort.
As to the burrs under the saddle, they might have got there by
accident. Even if they were put there by design, there was no
evidence that the mule objected. He owned a mule, whose demeanor
could not be changed one iota by all the burrs in the State
of Michigan.</p>

<p>Shindig Watkins, Elder Toots, Samuel Shin, and others argued
pro and con, and the question of whether the Major should
be bounced was put to a vote. The vote stood 43 for, and 44
against, and he thus escaped by the skin of his teeth.</p>

<h3>A MODEST TALE.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>It Is Cheerfully Told by a Georgia Munchausen.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>"I hardly feel like telling a modest tale," said another, "after
the wonderful things we have heard; but I will give you a true
story which was told me by a North Georgia cracker."</p>

<p>"Tell it, tell it!" they said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, once upon a time a man who lived by a creek in
North Georgia discovered that the corn was disappearing from
his crib. He watched and at length found the secret of the theft.</p>

<p>"A squirrel came down to the edge of the creek on the opposite
side, dragged a shingle to the water's edge, launched it,
and jumping on himself hoisted his tail for a sail. He soon sailed
across and anchored his shingle at the bank. Stealing up to
the crib, he got out an ear of corn and carried it to the creek, put
it on the shingle and ferried it across."</p>

<p>"How strange!" said some one.</p>

<p>"That's only the beginning," said the narrator.</p>

<p>"When the man saw his ear of corn disappear in a hollow tree
he determined to recover his lost property, and started, ax in
hand, to wade the creek. It was a little over waist deep, and
he had on a heavy overcoat fastened by one big button at the
top. As he came up out of the water the coat seemed exceedingly
heavy, and looking down he saw that both the big side
pockets were full of shad."</p>

<p>Here a chorus of laughter interrupted, but with a solemn face
the story teller went on:</p>

<p>"That was a small matter to those that follow. When the
man came up out of the water the weight of the wet overcoat,
further weighed with the fish, broke off the button, and it flew
off to one side where a rabbit crouched in the bush. The button
hit him in a tender spot behind the ear, and he keeled over, and
with a few pitiful kicks expired."</p>

<p>Here the laughter was so boisterous as to interrupt the narrator
for nearly a minute, and then he proceeded:</p>

<p>"Picking up the rabbit, the man concluded it was not the kind
of game he wanted, and he flung it aside. It was late in the
evening, and just at this moment it so happened that a covey of
partridges had huddled together for the night, with their heads
bunched together in the center, according to their habit."</p>

<p>Here a suppressed titter ran round the company.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the narrator, with some indignation, "it is well
known that partridges huddle together in just that way."</p>

<p>"Go on," they said.</p>

<p>"When the rabbit fell its head struck the bunch of heads and
killed all the partridges." (Laughter.)</p>

<p>"When the man had picked up the partridges he went to the
hollow tree and cut it down. He got back fifty bushels of corn,
and it proved to be a bee tree, so that he got ten barrels of honey.
Not only this, but the top of the tree fell in the stream, and the
creek ran sweet for twenty years."</p>

<p>This took the cake, which will be served next Sunday.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;There is no space here to tell about the Georgia hen
that turned gray after the snakes got her chickens, or the young
partridges that afterward hatched under her sitting and became
the solace of her declining years. All this and much more I
would tell if I had time.</p>

<h3>AFTER A CLEW.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>Methods of the Modern Detective Illustrated by a
Small Incident.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>"I'll follow him to the ends of the earth! He shall not escape
me!"</p>

<p>The tall, powerfully built man, attired in a suit of dark blue,
who hissed these words through his set teeth, stood in a shadow
of a one-story coal house in a dark, noisome, Philadelphia-like
alley, and watched with widely staring eyes a figure moving
slowly along down the Hong Kong district of Clark street.</p>

<p>The watcher was wide awake, and the saloons had not yet
closed for the night.</p>

<p>It was evident he was not a policeman.</p>

<p>Emerging from the alley he followed stealthily the object of
his pursuit like a sleuth hound on the track of its prey. Moving
along in the shadow of the buildings and halting now and then,
but never relaxing for one instant his eager watchfulness, he kept
his man in sight for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>Down Clark to Harrison, west on Harrison to the river, across
the bridge to Canal, up Canal to Monroe, and westward on that
street for many and many a weary block moved this singular&mdash;or
rather plural&mdash;procession.</p>

<p>"He little thinks he is followed," muttered the relentless
pursuer. "I'll shadow him to his lair now if it takes till the
next centennial!"</p>

<p>At last the man whom he was following halted at a modest
dwelling, opened the gate that afforded the entrance to the little
yard in front, and as he turned to close it his face, plainly visible
in the glare of a street lamp close by, was for one brief moment
exposed to the hawk-like gaze of the mysterious pursuer in the
dark blue suit, who had crouched in the shadow of a friendly
Indian cigar sign across the way. The next instant he had disappeared
within the house.</p>

<p>With a smothered cry of exultation the eager watcher took out
a note book and pencil and jotted down a memorandum. His
fingers trembled with excitement.</p>

<p>"I saw his face!" he said in a hysterical whisper. "I was
not mistaken. And now I have his street and number. At last
I am on the trail. If he finds out anything about that mysterious
disappearance I'll know just where he goes to get it. Ha! At
last! At last!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He was a high-priced detective shadowing a $15-a-week newspaper

mystery that was baffling the entire force.</p>

<h3>Two of a Kind.</h3>

<p>A bright little girl was taken by her father out into the country
to visit an uncle whom she called Walsh. As the two drove
along the country road, the little one spied a scarecrow in a field,
and exclaimed: "Oh, papa, there's Uncle Walsh." Papa laughed
hugely at the joke, but told her that she was mistaken; that what
she saw was only a scarecrow. A little further along and Uncle
Walsh's farm was reached, and way out in the field was Uncle
Walsh at work. The little girl's eyes were the first to catch sight
of him, but she wasn't to be fooled so easily this time. "Oh,
papa," she cried, "look at that scarecrow!" Papa did look, and
has not got through laughing yet.</p>

penny tin whistle attached to its tail. Three years later the bass
was caught near the same spot. It still weighed a pound, but
the whistle had grown into a fog horn.</p>

<h3>An Explanation.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Mrs. Smith&mdash;John, has Mrs. Thompson done anything to offend
you? She complains that you spoke very rudely to her when
you came in yesterday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Oh, I'm sorry for that. I'm always glad to see Mrs.
Thompson, and wouldn't like to hurt her feelings. Fact is, when
I came in, the room was rather dark and I mistook her for you.</p>

<h3>She Could Smell It.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Little Johnny McSwilligen, surreptitiously sampled his mamma's
brandied peaches yesterday, and soon after had occasion to
use the telephone.</p>

<p>"A little later Mr. McSwilligen called his wife to the 'phone to
inform her that he would be late getting home.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know why," she replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, how do you know?"</p>

<p>"Why, you're drinking again, and intend to make a night of
it."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not," protested McSwilligen. "I have not
touched a drop for a year."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't impose on me that way," insisted his wife.
"I can smell your breath."</p>

<p>And she hung up the receiver with a rattle that almost dislocated
the instrument.</p>

<h3>Offended.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Insulted Montanian (to tenderfoot newspaper correspondent)&mdash;Lookee
here, young man, you want to be a little more keerful how
you write things that ain't so to them newspapers back East.
This is a high-toned town, by Jinks, and the boys won't stand it.</p>

<p>Terrified Tenderfoot&mdash;Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;what have I written?</p>

<p>"Why, you writ to a Chicago paper that we lynched thirteen
men here last month, and it's a lie."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;thought it was true, or&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't. We didn't lynch but twelve, and we only
rid the other on a rail and peppered him a little with buckshot.
Stick to facts, young man, that's all we ask of you."</p>

<h3>Journalistic Comprehensiveness.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>A little fellow who was earnestly searching the columns of a
certain religious journal for something in the juvenile department,
found the paper rather bulky to manage and spread it upon the
floor. In reply to his little sister, who was impatient at his
slowness, he defended himself by saying: "Well, you must
remember that this paper has two parts&mdash;the religious and the
sacrilegious!" It was the same boy, by the way, who announced
that the Scripture lesson at school one morning was from the
Book of Collisions.</p>

my house last night.</p>

<p>"Huh! I've kicked out many a one. Young fellow, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No; past middle age."</p>

<p>"Well, these old codgers have no business to be coming around
sparking young girls. I kicked out one of that sort last week."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I've found out this man wasn't courting my daughter.
He was after my mother-in-law."</p>

<p>"Not exactly," was the quiet rejoinder, "but your brother
John asked me to lend him that sum and I didn't happen to have
it at the time."</p>

<h3>Burdette on Womankind.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Why am I a woman suffragist?</p>

<p>Because I am.</p>

<p>Because a woman has more good, hard, common sense than a
man.</p>

<p>Because she makes less bluster about her rights, and quietly
maintains them better than a man.</p>

<p>Because she won't give $1.50 for an article that she knows
very well she can get for 75 cents.</p>

<p>Because she does not stalk loftily away from the counter without
her change if the robber behind it is a little reluctant about
counting it out.</p>

<p>Because she is too independent to pay the landlord $2.25 for
her dinner, and then pay the head-waiter $1 to send her a waiter
who will bring it to her for 50 cents.</p>

<p>Because she will hold her money tightly in her own good little
right hand for two hours until she first gets a receipt for it from
the fellow who made her husband pay the same bill three times last
year. Not any "just give you credit for it" for her.</p>

<p>Because one day a Pullman porter complained to me "No
money on this trip; too many women aboard. Don't never get
nothin' out of a woman 'ceptin' just her regular fare." I had
just paid him 25 cents for blacking one of my boots and losing
the other; and when he said that, when I saw for myself the
heroic firmness of those women, traveling alone, paying their fare
and refusing to pay the salaries of the employes of a wealthy
corporation, I said: "These women have a right to vote. To
vote? By all that is brave and self-reliant and sensible, they
have a right to run the government!"</p>

<h3>It Was a Bad Mixing Up.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>In an English country church the curate had to give out two
notices, the first of which was about baptisms and the latter had
to do with a new hymn book. Owing to an accident he inverted
the order and gave out as follows: "I am requested to announce
that the new hymn book will be used for the first time in this
church Sunday next, and I am requested to call attention to the
delay which often takes place in bringing children to be
baptized; they should be brought on the earliest day possible.
This is particularly pressed on mothers who have young babies."</p>

<p>"And for the information of those who have none," added the rector,
in gentle, kindly tones and who, being deaf, had not heard
what had been previously said&mdash;"and for the information of those
who have none, I may state, if wished, they can be obtained on
application in the vestry immediately after service to-day. Limp
ones, one shilling each: with stiff backs, two shillings."</p>

attorney, looking at him keenly.</p>

again. Were you ever a train robber?"</p>

<p>"Judge," said the witness, turning imploringly to the dignitary
of the Bench, "must I answer that question?"</p>

<p>"You must," answered the judge. "And remember you are
under oath."</p>

<p>The witness turned pale and his knees knocked together.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's got to come out. I sold books and bananas on

<h3>An Accommodating Boss.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>A gang of men were at work on a city street, when a slight,
beardless youth laid down his pick, and approaching the foreman,
said to him:</p>

<p>"Can I take a fit, sir?"</p>

<p>"Take what?" asked the foreman.</p>

<p>"A fit&mdash;I feel one coming on," replied the young man, without
emotion.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said the foreman.</p>

<p>So the young man walked over to a bit of grass under a leafy
tree&mdash;it was a new street in the suburbs&mdash;and had a fit.</p>

<p>Then he went and washed his face, came back to his place in
the line, took up his pick and struck into work. After the day's
work was over the young man said to the foreman: "You don't
mind my having fits?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I guess not if you do a fair day's work."</p>

<p>"Well, you see I used to work for a butcher an' he wouldn't let
me take fits&mdash;said it interfered with business&mdash;an' I thought you
might feel the same way about it."</p>

<p>And the young man works hard with pick and shovel and
takes a fit once in a while as you or I might take a drink of
water.</p>

<h3>Unpatriotic.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>I always hate to tell a story out of season, but I am afraid that
this one will not keep until the next Fourth of July, so here goes:
A woman who lives in the western part of our city was very
much disturbed by the frightful noises which accompanied the
celebration this year. She was old and quite ill, and she had spent
a night in tossing, waiting in vain for a silence that came not and
which drove sleep out of the question. It was near sunbreak,
when the noise was at its wildest, when with a groan she turned
over and in despair ejaculated: "Goodness, gracious me. I
wish the other side had licked!"</p>

<h3>She Considered it a Deliberate Insult.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>When General O. O. Howard was marching down through
Tennessee, General Whittlesey, late president of the Freedmen's
Bank, was assistant adjutant general on his staff. Whittlesey
had been a clergyman down in Maine, and was fully as strait-laced
as Howard. One day Howard drove into a farm-yard from
which Whittlesey was just departing. A woman and her grown
daughter were standing outside the door.</p>

<p>"My good woman," said Howard, "will you kindly give me a
drink of water?"</p>

<p>"No. Get out of my yard. A lot of more impident Yankees
I never seed."</p>

<p>"But I have done nothing and said nothing out of the way,
and will severely punish any of my soldiers who should say or
do anything wrong."</p>

<p>"That sojer insulted me," said she, pointing to the retreating
form of General Whittlesey. "He axed me for a drink of water
and when I done give it to him he sassed me."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but that is General Whittlesey, of my staff. I am sure
he wouldn't be rude to any woman."</p>

<h3>MR. BOWSER ON DECK ONCE MORE.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>He Delivers a Lecture Upon the Carelessness of
Women.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>In returning from a trip down town the other week I left my
shopping bag in the car, and when I mentioned the fact to Mr.
Bowser and asked him to call at the street railway office and get
it, he replied:</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I won't! Anybody careless enough to leave an
article of value in a street car deserves to lose it. Besides, you
did not take the number of the car, and they would only laugh
at me at the office."</p>

<p>"Do you take the number of every street car you ride in?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Every sensible person does. Day before yesterday
I came up in No. 70. I went back in No. 44. I came up
to supper in No. 66. Yesterday I made my trips in Nos. 55, 61
and 38. To-day in Nos. 83, 77 and 15. The street railways contract
to carry passengers&mdash;not to act as guardians for children
and imbeciles."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bowser, other people have lost things on the street car."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;other women. You never heard of a man losing anything."</p>

<p>I let the matter drop there, knowing that time would sooner or
later bring my revenge. It came sooner than I expected. Mr.
Bowser took his dress coat down to a tailor to get a couple of
new buttons sewed on, and as he returned without it, I observed:</p>

<p>"You are always finding fault with the procrastination of my
dressmaker. Your tailor doesn't seem to be in any particular
hurry."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why, you were to bring that coat back with you."</p>

<p>"That coat! Thunder!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bowser turned pale and sprang out of his chair.</p>

<p>"Didn't lose it going down, did you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You left it on the street car when you come up?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bowser, anybody careless enough to leave an article of
value in a street car deserves to lose it. However, you took
the number of the car, I presume?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"You didn't! That shows what sort of a person you are.
Yesterday when I went down after baby's shoes I took car No.
111. When I returned I took car 86. When I went over to
mother's I took car 56. The conductor had red hair. One horse
was brown and the other black. The driver had a cast in his
left eye. There were four women and five men in the car. We
passed two loads of ashes, one of dirt and an ice cream wagon.
The conductor wore No. 8 shoes, and was nearsighted. The
street railways contract to carry passengers, Mr. Bowser, not to
act as guardians for sap heads and children."</p>

<p>"But I'll get it at the office to-morrow," he slowly replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but it is doubtful. As you can't remember the
number of the car they will laugh at the idea, and perhaps take
you for an impostor."</p>

<p>He glared at me like a caged animal, and made no reply, and
I confess that I almost hoped he would never recover the coat.
He did, however, after a couple of days, and as he brought it
home he looked at me with great importance and said:</p>

<p>"There is the difference, Mrs. Bowser. Had you lost anything
on the car it would have been lost forever. The street car
people were even sending out messengers to find me and restore
my property."</p>

<p>One day a laboring man called at the side door and asked for
the loan of a spade for a few minutes, saying that he was at work
near by; and he was so respectful that I hastened to accommodate
him. Two days later Mr. Bowser, who was working in the
back yard, wanted the spade, and I had to tell him that I lent it.
As it was not to be found the natural inference was that the borrower
had not returned it.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty state of affairs!" exclaimed Mr. Bowser
when he had given up the search. "The longer some folks live
the less they seem to know."</p>

<p>"But he looked honest."</p>

<p>"What of it? You had no business to lend that spade."</p>

<p>"I was sure he'd return it."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't, and anybody of sense would have known he
wouldn't. If somebody should come here and ask for the piano,
I suppose you'd let it go. Mrs. Bowser, you'll never get over your
countrified ways if you live to be as old as the hills. It isn't the
loss of the spade so much, but it is the fact that the man thinks
you are so green."</p>

<p>In the course of an hour I found the spade at the side steps,
where the man had left it after using, but when I informed Mr.
Bowser of the fact he only growled:</p>

<p>"He brought it back because he probably heard me making a
fuss about it and was afraid of arrest."</p>

<p>Two days later, as Mr. Bowser sat on the front steps, a colored
man came up and asked to borrow the lawn mower for a few
minutes for use on the next corner.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my boy," replied Mr. Bowser; "you'll find it in
the back yard."</p>

<p>When he had gone I observed that the man had a suspicious
look about him and that I should not dare trust him, and Mr.
Bowser turned on me with:</p>

<p>"What do you know about reading character? There never
was a more honest man in the world. I'd trust him with every
dollar I have."</p>

<p>In about half an hour Mr. Bowser began to get uneasy, and
after waiting a few minutes longer he walked down to the corner.
No black man. No lawn mower. By inquiry he learned that the
borrower had loaded the mower into a handcart and hurried off.
It was a clear case of confidence.</p>

<p>"Well?" I queried, as Mr. Bowser came back with his eyes
bulging out and his hair on end.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's gone!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I expected it. The longer some folks live the less they seem
to know. If somebody should come and want to borrow the
furnace or the bay windows you'd let 'em go, I suppose."</p>

<p>"But he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what of it? You had no business to lend that lawn
mower, Mr. Bowser. You'll never get over your countrified ways
if you live&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He would listen no further. He rushed out and sailed around
the neighborhood for two hours, and next morning got the police
at work, and it was three days before he would give up that he
had been "hornswagled," as one of the detectives put it. Then,
to add to his misery, the officer said:</p>

<p>"We'll keep our eyes open, but there isn't one chance in 500.
After this you'd better let your wife have charge of things. That
negro couldn't have bamboozed her that way."</p>

<h3>Both in Hard Luck.</h3>

<p>This story opens on the third floor of a Harlem compartment-house.</p>

<p>He had been twisting around his chair trying to find words to
express his undying devotion, and had already begun to hem and
haw, when a voice came from the floor below:</p>

<p>"Miss Candlewick," it said, "I love you passionately&mdash;madly;
bid me but hope, and all the dark colors of my life will change!"</p>

<p>This was a bonanza for the young man above.</p>

<p>"Miss Clara, darling," he said tremulously, "them's my sentiments."</p>

<p>Then another voice came from below:</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Goatee, I cannot bid you hope; I love another."</p>

<h3>He Got There All the Same.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>There is in Lewiston at least one man whose friends never
worry about his ability to take care of himself no matter where
he may be.</p>

<p>He went to the inauguration at Washington, last month, and
after hanging around in the rain for an hour and becoming thoroughly
wet, he thought it would be a good plan to go up and
stand under the capitol portico,&mdash;that being next best to admittance
to the capitol itself, which seemed to be out of the
question, as he had no ticket.</p>

<p>But when he tried to avail himself of this shelter, a policeman
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Can't I stand in here out of the rain?" the Lewistonian
asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"No," said the policeman, "not unless you have a ticket."</p>

<p>Our Lewiston friend stood by and exercised his wits for a
few moments. Presently two men in the capitol came out and
asked the policeman for checks, in order that they might get in
again.</p>

<p>"No checks," said the officer.</p>

<p>"But how are we going to get in when we come back?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, and I'll remember you."</p>

<p>The Lewiston man heard this and needed no other hint. He
retreated for a short time, then threw his coat back, tripped his
hat rakishly on the back of his head and started on a run for the
entrance, as though intending to brush right by the policeman.</p>

<p>"Hi!" said the officer, putting up his billy&mdash;"Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"Going in."</p>

<p>"Where's your ticket?"</p>

<p>"Ticket! Good gracious, you wouldn't give me any! You
said you'd remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! yes, yes! Pass right in."</p>

<p>And in he went.</p>

<p>The same gentleman once made a sixty days' tour of Europe
for a sum less than a hundred dollars, passage included.</p>

<p>A lady who is opposed to corporeal punishment visited a school
at the North End where the rod was being applied. Before

to come and see her on a certain evening, promising that her

and at the appointed time a boy dressed in his best was ushered
into her parlor, and for an hour or more his kind entertainers
devoted themselves to his enjoyment. Afterwards the older

good behavior and obedience to rules, when she was interrupted

<h3>A Puzzled Celt.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>A class in a San Francisco art school was recently startled by
the sudden appearance in its midst of a dilapidated Irishman
who, with tears in his eyes begged for enough money to get him
a "bite." The first impulse of the presiding genius was to request
him to move on, but his picturesque qualities suggested
that he be given a chance to earn his supper by sitting as a
model.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the instructor, kindly. "If you will permit
these young ladies to paint you we will pay you four bits. What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"Av Oi'll let 'em wha-at?" replied the beggar, with a puzzled
look on his face.</p>

<p>"Paint you. Paint you. It won't take very long."</p>

<p>"Bedad, Oi want th' foor bits bad enough," he returned, after
a moment's reflection, "an' Oi'll be viry gla-ad t' let th' young
ladies paint me av ye'll tell me how'll Oi'll git the paint arf me

<h3>HE WAS ONERY BUT INNOCENT.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>No Evidence to Convict Thomas of Stealing the Hog.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>When I reached Lester's Crossroads it was to find the score or
so of people comprising the hamlet very much excited, and their
numbers had been re-enforced by a dozen or more farmers, who
had come in on mules and in ox carts. I got accommodations at
Jeffers', and in a few minutes Mrs. Jeffers had posted me as to
the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>"Thar's gwine to be the powerfulest lawsuit nobody ever
hearn tell of," she explained. "Thar's gwine ter be as many as
ten witnesses, and the lawyers will gab, and the squar' will boss
everybody, and it will be the excitingest time we ever had. I'm
so glad you got yere in time!"</p>

<p>The squar' who lived a mile out of the hamlet took dinner with
us, also the lawyers, both of whom had made a ride of fifteen
miles in the interest of their respective clients. The squar' was
on his dignity, and the lawyers were looked up to with all the
reverence and respect due the president of the United States.
School was dismissed that the trial might take place in the
school-house, and when we all found seats the place was packed.
When the case was stated Thomas Andrews, a "squat farmer,"
was charged with having stolen, killed and converted to his own
use one hog belonging to and the lawful property of William
Ainsworth, another "squat farmer." The squar' opened his
own court as follows:</p>

<p>"Here ye and look yere! This court ar' now open fur bizness,
and it's agin the law to fuss or trifle. Them negroes and
all others is warned to be powerful quiet, and if ary purson be in
contempt he will get the full extent of the law. Hank Stovin,
kick that ar big dog of your'n outer doors."</p>

<p>The prosecutor then charged the prisoner with having, between
the 5th and the 20th of the month, stolen, killed and eaten, in
whole or in part one hog belonging to the plaintiff, and described
as black and white, 2 years old, weight 115 to 120 pounds, and
in good health and fair condition.</p>

<p>He was followed by the other lawyer who denied the charge in
toto, and intimated that he would prove a conspiracy to down
the defendant, to the injury of his name and fame as an honest
citizen of the commonwealth. The plaintiff was put on the
stand, and when told to go ahead he said:</p>

<p>"I know that he 'un stole my hog, and I wanter see him sent
to prison."</p>

<p>"Why do you suspect him of stealing the hog?"</p>

<p>"Hain't he shiftless and onery?"</p>

<p>"Is that why you suspected him?"</p>

<p>"It ar'. And I know the hog went over his way the last I
seed of him."</p>

<p>The plaintiff hadn't made out much, but he had a witness who
swore that he ate fresh pork at Andrews' cabin on the 12th. He
also saw hog bristles and hoofs on the ground near the cabin.</p>

<p>"You declare that on your oath, do you?"</p>

<p>"Sartin, I've got to tell it as it was, though Tom and I hev
always jiggered (got along) without a word."</p>

<p>A second witness swore that he called at Andrews' cabin on the
15th and the wife had fresh pork in a kettle. He asked if Tom
had been killing and she seemed confused and did not reply.
That was the case for the prosecution. It looked slim in one
sense, and yet everybody knew that Andrews was a shiftless,
suspicious character not above hog stealing. When the opposing
counsel got hold of the plaintiff he asked:</p>

<p>"Was this hog ranging the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was loosely about and around."</p>

<p>"Went where he pleased, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Reckon he did."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you know he is dead? How far have you
hunted for him?"</p>

<p>"Three miles."</p>

<p>"But he may be alive and well and four miles away."</p>

<p>"Couldn't be. Tom Andrews killed him."</p>

<p>"That's only your suspicion. Can you swear that that hog
isn't home this very minute?"</p>

<p>"Mebbe he ar', but I shan't dun giv in."</p>

<p>The witness who had sworn to eating pork at Andrews' table
was asked:</p>

<p>"Can you tell pork from a two-year-old hog from pig meat?"</p>

<p>"No, sah."</p>

<p>"Dare you swear that the meat you ate that day wasn't coon or
bear meat?"</p>

<p>"Reckon 'twas pork."</p>

<p>"Yes, you reckon, but do you know it was?"</p>

<p>"Dasn't dun sw'ar any harder, sah."</p>

<p>The second witness was also tangled up on cross-examination,
and then Andrews was put on the stand.</p>

<p>"Tom, did you ever see this hog in question?" asked his lawyer.</p>

<p>"Lawd, no!"</p>

<p>"How long since you had any fresh pork at your house?"</p>

<p>"Almost before the wah, sah."</p>

<p>"What meat did Miner eat there that day?"</p>

<p>"Coon, sah."</p>

<p>"What about those bristles and hoofs he says he saw?"</p>

<p>Tom produced a small package and opened it and displayed
the four feet of a coon and a handful of hair. He admitted on
cross-examination that he was onery, but he claimed to be honest.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Andrews," asked the lawyer when she was called, "do
you remember when Jackson called about the quilt frames?"</p>

<p>"'Deed, I do."</p>

<p>"Were you cooking meat?"</p>

<p>"Sartain, I was."</p>

<p>"Fresh pork?"</p>

<p>"No, sah&mdash;'possum."</p>

<p>"Were you confused?"</p>

<p>"Lawd save ye, but I was never dun confused in all my life."</p>

<p>The case wasn't very strong in a legal sense against Andrews,
but after it had been submitted his Honor called up all his dignity
and commanded:</p>

<p>"You thar! Tom Andrews, stand up!"</p>

<p>Tom arose.</p>

<p>"Prisoner," continued the judge, "you stole that air hog
suah's shooting! It's jist like you. You killed it and converted
it to your own use. I'm jist as satisfied of that as I ar' that you
took coons outen my trap last winter. However, they hain't
proved it down fine and I've got to turn ye loose. Ar' yer ears
wide open, Tom?"</p>

<p>"'Deed they is allus so."</p>

<p>"Then you skitter (listen) to what I'm going to say. Justice is
arter you. She hit your trail way back ten years ago, and she's
followin' right along. She moves slow but suah. She's gittin
very clus to your vest buckle, and when she reaches out fur ye it
will be good-by, Tom Andrews. You kin go loose, but it's only
fur a leedle while. Justice is givin' ye mo' rope so that the
bringin' up will be harder. Git out of yere and lumber yer carcass
off hum, and if I was the plaintiff I'd cut across lots and
meet ye down by the creek and lick the value of that hog outer
yer wrinkled hide. Court stands a-journed."</p>

<h3>Outwitted.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>As Rich, the harlequin, was one evening returning home from
the playhouse in a hackney coach, he ordered the coachman to
drive him to the Sun, then a famous tavern in Clare Market.
Just as the coach passed one of the windows of the tavern,
Rich, who perceived it to be open, dexterously threw himself
out of the coach window into the room. The coachman, who
saw nothing of this transaction, drew up, descended from his
box, opened the coach door, and let down the step: then taking
off his hat, he waited for some time, expecting his fare to alight;
but at length, looking into the coach, and seeing it empty, he
bestowed a few hearty curses on the rascal who had cheated
him, remounted his box, turned about, and was driving back to
the stand, when Rich, who had watched his chance, threw himself
into the coach, looked out, asked the fellow where in all the
world he was driving, and desired him to turn again. The
coachman, almost petrified with fear, instantly obeyed, and once
more drew up to the door of the tavern. Rich now got out;
and, after reproaching the fellow with stupidity, tendered him
his money.</p>

<p>"No, God bless your honor," said the coachman; "my
master has ordered me to take no money to-night."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Rich; "your master's a fool; here's a shilling
for yourself."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the coachman, who by that time had remounted
his box, "that won't do; I know you too well, for all your
shoes&mdash;and so, Mr. Devil, for once you're outwitted."</p>

<h3>Trotters' Rival.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>"I'll do it," he repeated, grinding his teeth and showing the
whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Matilda. "You ought to be ashamed of
yourself for threatening such wickedness&mdash;and besides, you don't
mean it. Go along!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" exclaimed William Trotters, in a hollow voice.
"Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"You give me the creeps when you laugh like that," said Matilda;
"and all the way to Gravesend you grumbled&mdash;when you
weren't seasick. That is pretty lover, to go and be bilious on
a pleasure trip!"</p>

<p>"It was the iron that had entered into my soul, Matilda," remarked
Trotters, solemnly.</p>

<p>"It disagreed with you, whatever it was," said Matilda, tossing
her pretty head and turning up her nose. "And when
another gentleman&mdash;a stranger&mdash;was attentive, and took care of
me, instead of being grateful, you went on like a mad bull, and
talked about having his gore."</p>

<p>"Either his or my own," groaned Trotters. "Oh, woman!
why art thou thus?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want to marry us if we weren't, would you,
gaby?" snapped Matilda. "Give me that nasty thing, there, do!"
She pointed to Trotters' breast pocket, which, as far as could be
seen by the light of the street-lamp near them, looked bulky.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Trotters, recoiling.</p>

<p>"It'll go off one of these days, I know it will," sobbed Matilda,
"and then you'll be sorry."</p>

<p>A smile illumined Trotters' visage. Nobody knew better than
himself that the deadly weapon wasn't loaded. He had bought
it of a marine store dealer, cleaned and polished it&mdash;it was a five-chambered
revolver&mdash;and clicked the trigger three or four times
to make sure; but even that made him nervous.</p>

<p>"She's really frightened!" he said, as he walked away.</p>

<p>An irresistible impulse came over him to frighten her a little
more. He went back. He peeped over the garden gate. The
house stood dark and silent. Everybody had gone to bed. He
would steal round into the back garden and throw a little gravel
up at Matilda's window. That would bring her down.</p>

<p>The onion and cabbage beds rose right up to the house wall.
In the soft mould his footsteps fell silent. Ha! what was that?
Jealousy! Wrath! Revenge!</p>

<p>A male figure stood in the center of the onion-bed. Its hat was
cocked on one side, its gaze uplifted to Matilda's window. One
arm was stretched out in an attitude of supplication. A bush
rustled as Trotters stole warily behind him. Matilda's window
opened. Matilda's voice queried, "Is that you, dear?" It was
too much. Trotters drew the fatal pistol and clapped it to his rival's
ear.</p>

<p>"Stir a step and you're a dead man!" he hissed, trying to
steady his shaking hand. Too late! There was a flash&mdash;a terrible
explosion! The stranger fell prone, and lay motionless on
the ground.</p>

<p>Trotters was unaware that his cousin Jack, who was in the
Carabineers, had expressed much curiosity regarding the weapon
Trotters carried with such jealous solicitude, and, being of a larksome
disposition, had surreptitiously gained possession of the revolver,
placed a blank cartridge in each of the barrels, and returned
it to the pocket of the unsuspecting Trotters, or he might
have behaved differently. But no, he felt that in his passionate
jealousy he had committed a deadly crime, and sent to his last
account an innocent man. 'Twas too much. Trotters shrieked
aloud in terror, and then fainted.</p>

<p>Matilda flew down to him with her hair in curl-papers. They
found him lying cold and motionless beside the garden scarecrow!</p>

<p>The father looked fixedly at the young man. "What are
your prospects in life, Julius?" he said.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, sir," acknowledged young Springbyle,
"I have no prospects worth mentioning. I am in moderate
circumstances and have no resources except a knowledge of my
business, good health and steady habits."</p>

<p>"Just so, Julius," mused the father. "Your income, I dare
say, is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About $1,200 a year."</p>

<p>"And on this, my young friend, you would expect to support
yourself and a young woman who has lived in a home where she
has never been used to anything like privation, or even judicious
economy?"</p>

<p>"It does seem presumptuous for me to think of it," faltered the
youth, "and as I see it does not meet with your approval I will

<p>"Stay, Julius!" exclaimed Mr. Kajones, somewhat hastily.
"I only asked you those questions as a matter of form. If you
want Maria, my boy, you can have her!" And he shook the
young man warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Kajones, it may be proper to state, has eight unmarried
daughters besides Maria.</p>

<p>A Pittsburgh doctor says he can diagnose ailments by examining
a single hair of the patient. Two young men, as a joke, took
him a hair from a bay horse. The doctor gravely wrote a prescription,
and said his fee was $25, as the case was precarious.
They were staggered, but paid the fee, and after they got out
laughed all the way to the apothecary's. The latter took the prescription
and read in amazement: "One bushel of oats, four
quarts of water, stir well, and give three times a day, and turn
the animal out to grass!" Then the jokers stopped laughing.</p>

<h3>MR. BOWSER AS A WHITEWASHER.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>He Is Not a Howling Success at Inside Decorating.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>There were several little things I wanted done about the house
this fall, and so the other week I engaged a colored man to come
and work for a couple of days. It so happened that he came one
morning before Mr. Bowser had left the house, and was greeted
with:</p>

<p>"Well, what's up now?"</p>

<p>"I'ze dun bin hired to work, sah."</p>

<p>"Who hired you?"</p>

<p>"De lady, sah."</p>

<p>"What to do?"</p>

<p>"Jobbin', sah."</p>

<p>"Well, the lady has changed her mind and doesn't want
you."</p>

<p>After the man had gone, Mr. Bowser came into the house and
asked:</p>

<p>"Did you hire a colored man?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I was going to have him whitewash the vegetable cellar,
take down and clean the laundry stovepipe and do some other
jobs."</p>

<p>"H'm! Mrs. Bowser, I don't believe in encouraging such
people. He'd have done about one hour's work and charged you
for a whole day. I don't believe he knows any more about
whitewashing than I do about playing the harp."</p>

<p>"But he said he did."</p>

<p>"Certainly. Did you ever see a negro who wouldn't say anything
to fit the occasion?"</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"There is no 'but' about it. If there are any little jobs about
the house I've got plenty of time to do them. In fact, I need
just such exercise. Such work is a diversion to me, and the doctor
recommends it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you will do the whitewashing?"</p>

<p>"I do. I don't do it to save a dollar, but for my own benefit.
I always like the smell of lime."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't do it. You will get lime in your eyes,
and you will blame me for it, and&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"There you go! Blame you! What would I blame you
about? If I get lime in my eyes it's my own fault. Mrs. Bowser,
you are getting to be a good deal of a crank lately."</p>

<p>"Well, if you are determined on it, don't say that I asked you
or encouraged you."</p>

<p>"That's a funny way to talk to me, Mrs. Bowser! Are you
getting ready for the insane asylum? I think I run my own
house yet. If I'm willing to peel off and do these odd jobs, I
ought to be encouraged instead of insulted."</p>

<p>I was quite sure how it would end, but I said nothing more,
and in the course of half an hour he got into his old clothes and
went down cellar. I followed him down to give him a few last
words of advice, but he didn't need them.</p>

<p>"You go right upstairs and sit down and enjoy yourself," he
said. "Here's the brush and here's a pail of lime, and if I
don't white-wash more cellar in ten minutes than Moses could in
all day, I'll never try it again. Besides, Mrs. Bowser, whitewashing
is not the slouch work you imagine it to be. It has got
to be done by a person of taste and intelligence or it won't stand.
I want a little blueing to give it a tinge."</p>

<p>"You understand," I said, as I got what he wanted, "that I
did not ask you to do this work."</p>

<p>"Ask me! What on earth ails you, Mrs. Bowser? You are
making fuss enough over ten minutes' work to warrant a year's
job."</p>

<p>"It must be well done."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Two coats all around."</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"Even if it takes you all day?"</p>

<p>"Even if it takes me over half an hour, which it won't. I'll
show you a job here that will make a black man turn green with
envy. Just run upstairs and make yourself comfortable."</p>

<p>I retreated up the stairs to the kitchen door and waited for
results, which I knew were sure to come. Mr. Bowser dipped
and dished and sozzled and stirred until he had the liquid to
his liking, and as he began on the stone wall I heard him
chuckling:</p>

<p>"I said fifteen minutes, but I'll go slow and take twenty. The
idea of a colored man sloshing around here all day to do this
work. Let's see. I believe I'll take the overhead first."</p>

<p>I held my breath in suspense for a long minute. Then a yell
arose from that cellar which jumped the cook out of her old
slippers and made her cry out:</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Mrs. Bowser, have we been struck by
another cyclone?"</p>

<p>There was a second and a third yell, and as I hurried downstairs
Mr. Bowser stood in the middle of the cellar, hands out-stretched
and jumping up and down as if he had fire under his
feet.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, what is it, Mr. Bowser?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Whitewash&mdash;lime&mdash;fire!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In my eyes! I'm blind! I've burned them out!"</p>

<p>I got hold of him and led him out to the laundry tubs and set
the water to running. He had indeed got a dose in his eyes, but
it was more painful than dangerous. He could hardly see daylight
after we had washed out all the lime, and as I led him upstairs
he said:</p>

<p>"I shall never see again!"</p>

<p>I washed his eyes with milk and got him to lie down on the
lounge, and in a couple of hours he was pretty near all right.
His eyes were sore, but no great damage had been done. He
was very gentle until he discovered this. Then he suddenly
turned on me with:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser, what possible excuse can you urge in extenuation
of your conduct?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean? That's a cool question to ask me! In
view of what has transpired what have you to say?"</p>

<p>"I say that you were foolish to undertake the job. I warned
you how it would turn out."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser!" he shouted, squirting tears of lime water
out of his eyes, "do you pretend to deny that you didn't encourage
me to undertake a task which you knew would put my
whole future happiness, if not my life, in peril?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir. I did all I possibly could to dissuade you."</p>

<p>"And you are not to blame?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser, this is too much&mdash;too much! I could forgive
one who had wronged me, if penitent, but when they attempt to
brazen it out it is time for action. We will settle on the amount
of alimony right here and now."</p>

<p>But we didn't. After blinking around for half a day he went
down town, and when he came home to supper he was as
good-natured as pie. I got a colored man to come and do the
work, and two or three days later, when Mr. Bowser happened
down cellar, I heard him saying to himself:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a mighty slick job I did on this, and I'll tackle that
stovepipe to-morrow morning."</p>

<h3>The Latest About Kissing.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Men have often remarked on the fertility of woman's mind.
Physiologists declare she never reasons, but as an instinctive
creature she often reaches a correct conclusion much quicker than
a man. If they lack the intricate process of ratiocination they
have the happy faculty of walking straight through mental difficulties
like a somnambulist in sleep.</p>

<p>The fellows who discuss "Is Marriage a Failure?" or "Why
I am a Bachelor," have wondered lately how women reach their
cute noses with a handkerchief since the advent of the new
fangled veil. It covers the greater part of the face, and is as ornamental
possibly as protective.</p>

<p>Two women veiled alike met yesterday. It was evident that
they hadn't seen each other for some time, and they rushed together
in a long embrace. The inevitable kiss came next. Both
essayed the attempt, but the veils rendered this impossible.
Quick as a flash one of the ladies turned the side of her face to
her companion and the latter smacked a spot on her cheek somewhere
below the ear. This was satisfactory and then followed
the usual storm of quick womanly ejaculations.</p>

<p>"Is kissing on the lips no longer fashionable?" queried a reporter
of a lady he met after this event.</p>

<p>"No, not since the introduction of the new veil," she answered
sweetly. "You see the lips are completely covered, and it has
become the fashion to press the lips against the cheek. This
thing of kissing is a nuisance anyhow, and I wish the ladies
would all stop it."</p>

<h3>The Sly Way in Which Prohibition Works.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>A week or two ago a well-known dealer in live stock of this
city went over to Washington County to make a deal with a big
stock raiser, who is also prominent as a strict Prohibitionist.
The cattle having been inspected and the price agreed upon, the
Washington County man retired to the house to make out a receipt
and so on, leaving the Pittsburgher in his son's hands. As
soon as the old man had disappeared indoors his son, a bright
lad, nearing his majority, said to the Pittsburgher:</p>

<p>"This is rather dry work talking all day, ain't it?"</p>

<p>The Pittsburgher vehemently assented.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the young man, "I've a bottle out in the
haymow, and we might as well get a taste of the stuff while
dad's not by."</p>

<p>The Pittsburgher said "yes" again, and the two repaired to the
haymow and looked upon the contents of the black bottle. Then
the young Washingtonian hid the bottle in the haymow, saying
as he did so: "Don't tell the old man anything about this&mdash;he's
awful down on drinking."</p>

<p>Of course the Pittsburgher vowed silence as he smacked his
lips and left the barn. Two minutes later he was in the house
paying over the money to the old stock raiser. After the business
in hand had been dispatched and the bargain had been
closed the Pittsburgher was about to take his leave, when the old
man said, rather awkwardly: "Say, are you feelin' dry? I've a
jug down in the cellar, and the liquor's fine."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say they were soon in the cellar. As
the old Prohibitionist drained his glass he said to his guest:
"Don't say nothing 'bout this to them boys o' mine&mdash;they don't
know about the jug!"</p>

<h3>How She Told the Latest Joke.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Mrs. Jason came home the other evening with her face
"wreathed in smiles," as the novelists have it.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you grinning at?" was the cordial greeting
of her lord and master.</p>

<p>"I heard something funny down town," she answered.</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much. I happened to meet little Johnny Figg,
who used to keep the apple stand across the way, you know,
and he's got a better one down town now. I asked him how he
was getting along and he says to me, 'Oh, I'm still keeping a
stand, you see.' I thought it was the cutest thing I had heard
for a good while."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you, Maria? If I ever see where the
laugh comes in I'll try and smile, even if I have to get up in the
middle of the night to do so," was his crushing reply, to which
she deigned no answer.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning Mr. Jason was awakened
from a dream of being stabbed by a masked assassin, to find his
wife energetically nudging him below the fifth rib.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jehiel, I had that wrong," she twittered, in a tone of
one who has made a great discovery. "Johnny said his business
was at a stand still. You see the point now, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon so," said the old man in no gracious tones,
"and if I feel the point of your infernal elbow jabbing me in the
ribs any more to-night I'll go to sleep in the barn. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"And he didn't laugh either as he promised to," was her reflection
as she settled down to sleep again with the sweet consciousness
of duty performed.</p>

<h3>His First Shave.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>This is a momentous event in a boy's life, as it is to him the
line of demarcation between boyhood and manhood.</p>

<p>The microscopic indications under his chin are becoming annoying
to him, and he considers it a duty to society to have them
removed without delay.</p>

<p>He has already made several surreptitious attempts with his
father's razor, to the great detriment of both the razor and his
face, and although he succeeded, in a measure, in removing the
obnoxious down, yet it was with the unpleasant accompaniment
of some of his chin. Therefore he determines to do the thing in
a manly way, and resolves to submit to the barber's delicate
manipulations without delay.</p>

<p>It takes him some time to muster up the requisite courage to
enter the barber's shop, as he has certain misgivings that the
barber might indulge in facetious and satirical remarks concerning
his beard.</p>

<p>He passes the shop many times and looks in; but his heart
sinks within him. There is always some drawback&mdash;either too
many people inside or too few; in either case of which he thinks
he will be noticed. Once he does enter; and one of the barbers
venturing the inquiry, "Hair cut, sir?" involves him in delightful
confusion, and to avoid further embarrassment, he submits to
having his hair cut, and still remains unshaved.</p>

<p>At last, in sheer desperation, he makes a very firm resolve
either to get shaved that day or never. With this heroic resolve,
and twopence in his hand, he sallies forth to the barber's, and at
a favorable moment walks in and tremblingly awaits his turn.</p>

<p>The sharp, short "Next!" sends the blood thrilling up his
backbone, and he feebly climbs into the chair, and hurriedly
says, "Shave me, please," and shuts his eyes.</p>

<p>The barber, with an eye to the twopence, says nothing, and
proceeds to shave him, figuratively speaking. There is only one
drawback to the boy's cup of happiness, and that is the entire
absence of that peculiarly pleasant rasping sound which comes
only from a long experience.</p>

<h3>MR. BOWSER IN THE COUNTRY.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>He Enjoys Fresh Air and Mosquitoes to His Heart's
Content&mdash;His Original Method of Milking
Not Indorsed by the Cow.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>"Well, what do you think!" exclaimed Mr. Bowser as he came
hurrying home from the office the other afternoon.</p>

<p>"Have you gone and got some more hens or bought another
horse?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser, the event of our life is about to happen."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"You know Gregg? Well, Gregg owns a little farm out here
about twelve miles. There's a good house on it, and he says we
can occupy it for the summer. We will have a cow and a horse,
pigs, poultry and other stock, and we'll go out there and tan up
and get fat and have the best time in the world."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of the idea, Mr. Bowser."</p>

<p>"You don't. You don't want cool breezes&mdash;fresh eggs&mdash;fresh
berries&mdash;rich milk&mdash;songs of birds&mdash;lowing of the kine and rest
from care!"</p>

<p>"You will be disappointed if you expect any such thing."</p>

<p>"I will, eh? Perhaps I don't know what the country is. You
are always ready to throw cold water on any of my plans. I
shall go, anyhow."</p>

<p>That was the beginning, and at the end of three days I yielded,
womanlike.</p>

<p>One Monday morning we took the train and started, having
engaged a farmer's daughter to take charge of the kitchen, and
at the nearest railroad station we were met by a farmer and his
lumber wagon. The sun poured down its hottest, the dust had
covered grass and bushes, and as we jogged and jolted along the
farmer queried of Mr. Bowser:</p>

<p>"Come out for your health, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"We did. Ah! this country air has already refreshed me."</p>

<p>"Has, eh? Well, there's heaps of it, and I'm thinking you'll
get all you want in about a week. I think a city chap is a
blamed fool to come out here."</p>

<p>"Do you? Why, the doctors recommended it. That boy ought
to gain a pound a day, and I am sure my wife will brace right up
with these pastoral scenes before her eyes."</p>

<p>"The doctors and pastoral scenes be darned!" growled the
farmer, as he turned to his horses, and those were the last words
he uttered until he landed us at the gate.</p>

<p>It was a comfortable frame house, and I did not observe the surroundings
until after dinner. The barn had partly fallen in, giving
it a weird and lonely look; most of the fencing was down, a
gust of wind had laid the smoke-house on its back, and nearly
every tree and bush about the house was dead or dying.</p>

<p>"Is this one of the pastoral scenes you referred to?" I asked
Mr. Bowser.</p>

<p>"There you go!" he snapped. "You can't expect things to
look as nice out here as in Central Park. We come for the
balmy breezes and the rest."</p>

<p>"You spoke of hunting hens' eggs in the meadow grass."</p>

<p>"So we will&mdash;come on."</p>

<p>He made a dash for a big patch of burdocks near the back door,
got tangled up in the ruins of a barrel, and when he got up he
had a cut on his chin and his nose was bleeding. He tried to
make light of the affair, but it was hard work.</p>

<p>When I asked after the horse and vehicle in which we were to
take our morning jaunts he walked down to the barnyard and
pointed out a raw-boned old yellow horse, so weak that he could
not brush the flies away, and a one-horse wagon, quaint enough
to have taken its place in a museum.</p>

<p>"You'll have our photographs taken after we all get seated in
that rig, won't you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's it; just as I expected. Mrs. Bowser, what did you
come out here for?"</p>

<p>"Because you obliged me to."</p>

<p>"I did, eh! Not by a long shot! You came to restore your
health and to give our child a chance for his life. It will be the
making of him. No more doctor's bills for us."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. Bowser swung his hammock in the orchard.
This was something he had doted on for a week. He had
scarcely dropped into it when three or four caterpillars dropped
on to him, and he put in the rest of the afternoon on the hard
boards of the veranda. The cow came sauntering up about 5
o'clock, covered with flies and mosquitoes, and the girl hinted to
Mr. Bowser that he was expected to milk.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," he replied. "I wouldn't give a cent for
farm life unless I could milk a cow or two. I used to sing a ballad
while I was milking."</p>

<p>The girl and I watched him as he took the pail and stool and
approached the cow. The cow also watched him. Folks generally
sit down on the right-hand side of the cow to milk. Mr.
Bowser took the other side.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?" I called to him from the gate.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowser, when I want to learn anything about a cow
I'll ask you for the information. I think I know my business."</p>

<p>So did the cow. She had been fooled with long enough, and
she suddenly planted a hoof against Mr. Bowser with such vigor
that he tumbled over in a confused heap. Between us we got
him into the house, and the girl finished the milking. Mr.
Bowser recovered from the shock after a while, and I felt it my
duty to inquire:</p>

<p>"Mr. Bowser, don't you think a week of these pastoral scenes
will be enough for us?"</p>

<p>"No, nor six weeks!" he growled. "Nothing would do but
you must go into the country, and now I'll give you enough of
it."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Bowser?"</p>

<p>"You needn't why Mr. Bowser me! You gave me no peace
until I agreed to come, and now I'll remain here five straight
years."</p>

<p>When the summer sun went down and the stars came out we
were not as happy as we might have been. Mr. Bowser still held his
hand on his stomach, the baby cried because the milk tasted of
wild onions, and the girl lost the old oaken bucket in the thirty-foot
well while getting a pail of fresh water. I asked Mr. Bowser
when the kine would begin to low and the whippoorwills to sing,
and he was so mad he wouldn't speak. However, if the kine
didn't low, the pinchbugs and mosquitoes did. There wasn't a
screen at door or window, and soon after sundown we were besieged.</p>

<p>That night seemed never ending. No one of us three slept a
wink. The room was invaded with every insect known to country
life, from a bat to a gnat.</p>

<p>When we got up in the morning the girl didn't know us. We
were blotched and bitten until one would have suspected us of
suffering with smallpox. Mr. Bowser knew himself, however,
and before noon we were back in the city. He scarcely spoke to
me all the way home, but once in the house he burst out with:</p>

<p>"Now, old lady, prepare for a settlement! You've nosed me
round all you ever will. This has broken the camel's back.
Which of us applies for a divorce?"</p>

<h3>His Complexion Was Against Him.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Hadji Hassein Ghooly Khan, envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary from Persia, was one of the favorites in Washington
society while there. He was very fond of going out and
calling on the ladies, and was always most hospitably received
wherever he went. That is, almost always, for an experience he
had one Sunday afternoon proved that he was not as cordially
received at one house as had been his wont. Ghooly Khan started
out with the purpose of making a round of calls. It is his
custom to pay his respects to the ladies of the fashionable world
on Sunday the same as on the week days. The day being an extremely
pleasant one, his landau was not brought into use. He
walked from his residence on M street, to Massachusetts avenue,
in the neighborhood of Fourteenth street, where the subjects of
his first call resided. Walking up the stone steps in an indolent
fashion, he reached the door and rather timidly touched the electric
bell. After lingering some moments the servant appeared,
and before Ghooly Khan could utter a word she shouted out:
"The ladies are all busy and cannot be bothered with you now."</p>

<p>"Well," said the minister, completely nonplussed, "there must
be a mistake; take in my card."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't worry them now," answered the servant, not
allowing him to finish his sentence. "They are all about going
to dinner and don't care for any one to see them at this time&mdash;you'd
better come again in the morning; and the side door is
always the handiest place for such as yez to call."</p>

<p>The minister waited for no more. The rebuff he had received
at the hands of the unruly servant completely paralyzed him.
He concluded that he had a sufficient dose of American society.</p>

<p>The ladies of the house soon learned of the "horrible" manner
in which their distinguished caller had been received, and they
at once made heroic and happily successful efforts to have the
affair settled on a basis satisfactory not only to themselves but to
the distinguished envoy from Teheran.</p>

<h3>The Difference.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The following anecdote, which we have received as authentic
from the lips of a clergyman, sets forth in a very pleasant way
the folly of reproaching preachers as hirelings, merely because
they receive temporal support from their congregations.</p>

<p>At the meeting of a presbytery in an eastern state, it fell to the
lot of one of the ministers to be quartered with a man belonging
to a denomination which does not allow of salaried preachers.
He was accosted by his host as follows:</p>

<p>"What is thy name, friend? I mean the name thy parents
gave thee."</p>

<p>"John."</p>

<p>"Has thee any objections that I should call thee by that
name?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; my mother always calls me John."</p>

<p>"Well, John, I understand thee belongs to the class of hireling
preachers."</p>

<p>"You are greatly mistaken, sir; I do not belong to that
class."</p>

<p>"I mean thee is one of those preachers who receive pay for
preaching."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I receive nothing for preaching to my people."</p>

<p>"How then," said the interrogator, evidently surprised and
disconcerted, "does thee manage to live?"</p>

<p>"Why, I work for my people six days, and then I preach for
them on Sundays for nothing."</p>

<h3>One of Chauncey's Latest.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Chauncey M. Depew tells the following story of another of
the many interesting characters he encountered last Fall while
addressing his fellow citizens on the vital issues of the campaign.
It doesn't sound so much like a true story as some that are extant,
but it is getting pretty late in the day to doubt his word:</p>

<p>One night, after the meeting was over and while the hall was
clearing, a weather-beaten man buttonholed me and said:</p>

<p>"I'm postmaster out here at Shingle Corners. Blaze away
and elect your man if you want to."</p>

<p>"You don't care for the office, then?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, that ain't it," he replied. "It don't pay but $14 a year,
or mebbe good years, when I boom 'er a little, $15, but it's powerful
handy to have in the house. No, my idee is that we can
keep it in the fam'ly anyhow."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"The old woman, you see, she's a rip-snortin' Republican,
powerful so, reg'lar uncompromisin'. If Cleveland gets it I stay;
if Harrison slides in the old woman comes to the front for her reward.
Nobody else wants it, so there we be."</p>

<p>"Well, you're all right then."</p>

<p>"You bet we are. If we get tired of it or too old for it, or
anything ever, there's my boy, a red-hot Republican, and my
oldest gal, Democrat from 'way back. Oh, we're hustlers in our
fam'ly when it comes to politics."</p>

<p>"But suppose the Mugwumps should develop power some day
and carry things?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "we will soon be fixed for that, too. The
baby is a Mugwump&mdash;I know it 'cause he howls all the time. If
you see anybody lookin' for p'ints on keepin' a good thing in the
family jess send him out to Shingle Corners."</p>

<h3>A Point Usually Overlooked.</h3>

<p>The youthful heir to a Walnut Hills ancestral establishment is
of an inquiring turn of mind and directs his attention especially
to the elucidation of religious problems. Last week he heard a
Sunday school address on "The Prodigal Son." Just what the
small boy thought of the address his father was curious to learn,
and so he said to him that night at supper: "My son, tell me
which of the characters in the parable of the prodigal son you
sympathized with?" "Well, papa," replied the cherub with
perfect nonchalance, "I think I'd feel disposed to sympathize
most with the calf."</p>

that there was nothing so beautiful in a house as a bevy of
bright children. "I have a very lovely family," said he. "I
hold, as the sinful world would say, a bobtail flush."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Hon. Charles B. Farwell, the well-known
collector of Bibles and psalm books.</p>

<p>"We were talking about children," exclaimed Mr. Gunsaulus,
"and I was saying that in our family we had a bobtail flush&mdash;four
girls and a boy."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Farwell, smiling sadly; "it is evident that
you have had no experience in the ways of the world, otherwise
you would not make so erroneous an application of terms. You
do not hold a bobtail flush; you hold four of a kind&mdash;four queens
and a jack&mdash;a powerful good hand, sir, and I should advise you
to stand pat."</p>

<h3>Confiding.</h3>

<p>A Chicago gambler, whose first name was George, used to visit
a Chinaman's establishment and smoke opium almost daily. One
day he rushed into the place and said, excitedly: "Hip, loan me
$10. Thanks. I'll come in and pay you to-morrow noon, if I'm
alive," and out he went with the money. About three o'clock
the next afternoon a friend of the gambler dropped in on the
Chinaman and said: "Hip, where is George to-day?" and the
confiding Celestial wiped his eyes with the corner of his blouse
and replied: "George, him dead."</p>

<h3>A Nun-Like Girl and Her Mischievous Friend.</h3>

<p>It was on the St. Jose train and two young ladies&mdash;one as
serious and good as a little nun, the other with a black eye with
the devil's own glint in it&mdash;sat behind the youngest minister in
town. The quiet one held in her hand a purple pansy so large
that it attracted the attention of the young minister. While he
was still looking at it the train rushed into a tunnel. The black-eyed
young woman grabbed the pansy in the darkness from her
companion, and leaning over, dropped it into the lap of the
godly man. When the train reached daylight again the young
minister had turned, and with the pansy in his hand was glaring
reprovingly at the nun-like girl between whose fingers he had
seen the flower. Her face was blazing and her downcast eyes
seemed to confess her guilt. The whole car snickered and the
malicious black-eyed girl read her book unconsciously.</p>

<p>This is why the young minister preached on the iniquity of
flirting, yesterday.</p>

<h3>An Effective Mule Invigorator.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>While traveling in Virginia some time ago with a doctor we
came upon an old colored man who was standing by a mule
hitched to an old two-wheel vehicle. "Dis mule am balked,
boss," said the old man; "an' I'll jis gib a dollah to de man what
can start 'im."</p>

<p>"I will do it for less than that, uncle," said the doctor. He
took his case from the carriage and selected a small syringe,
which he filled with morphin. He went to the side of the mule
and quickly inserting the syringe in his side pushed the contents
into the animal. The mule reared upon his hind legs and giving
an astonishing bray started down the road at a break neck speed.
The aged colored man gave a look of astonishment at the doctor,
and with a loud "Whoa!" started down the road after the mule.
In the course of ten minutes we came up to the old man standing
in the road waiting for us. The mule was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>"Say, boss," said the darky, "how much you charge for dat
stuff you put in dat mule?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ten cents will do," laughingly replied the doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, boss, heah is twenty cents. Squirt some of dat stuff in
me. I must ketch dat ar mule."</p>

<h3>MRS. FLYNN AND THE GOAT.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h3>The Lady's Stirring Narrative, with Spring Lamb
Trimmings.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Mrs. Flynn relates with much pathos an incident in her life,
that graphically illustrates woman's trustfulness and man's perfidy.</p>

<p>"Oi waz in the market wan mornin' lookin' fer some mate, an'
a Dootch butcher axed me how an illegant bit av Spring lamb
wad soot. Oi sed it wad do af it waz good, an he sed it waz the
best in the market or he wudn't be offerin' it to a lady loike meself.
Oi'm fond av Spring lamb, an so Oi took a hunk av it home
an' cooked it fer me ould mon an' meself.</p>

<p>"May the divil take me av it tasted roight. It had a sort av a
rank an romantic flavor thet Oi niver kem across afore, an'
heaven help me, may Oi niver come across it again.</p>

<p>"Oi kept me jaw to meself, and said nathin'. After dinner
the ould mon said the Spring lamb tasted kin o' quare an' he wondered
had Oi cooked the baste enough. Oi said Oi had cooked the
baste joost roight, an' Oi saw nathin wrong wid the taste av it.</p>

<p>"Whin the ould mon had gone out to wurruk, Oi tuk a luck
at the chunk av mate that was left, an' phat do you tink Oi saw?
A bit av the skin av the varmint, an' it had hair on it instead of
wool, begorra. The thavin' Dootchman hed sold me goat instead
av lamb! Bad luk to him!</p>

<p>"Oi coodn't affoord to lose the mate, d'ye see, an' so Oi kept
me jaw to meself an' said nothin agin. Oi stewed it up wid
spices and tings to disguoise the taste, an' we had it agin fer supper.
Oi told the ould mon Oi didn't care fer enny Spring lamb
fer supper, but it wuz very beautiful cooked up wid spices, an
he needed plenty av mate now that he wuz wurkin' wid the Park
Commishioners. He ate awhoile, an' thin he said the Spring
lamb tasted kind o' quare, an' he thought it wuz too high-toned
fer us.</p>

<p>"'Now, me darlint,' Oi said, 'the Spring lamb is a little high-toned,
but it is none too good fer the loikes av us, an' ye moost ate
hearty so ye can do good wurruk fer the Park Commishioners.'</p>

<p>"He said the Park Commishioners be blowed, an' he cood do
good enough wurruk fer them on roast bafe, an' wad Oi git roast
bafe the nixt toime?</p>

<p>"Oi said, 'My darlint, av coorse Oi'll git roast bafe the nixt
toime, but we moost ate all the Spring lamb foorst.'</p>

<p>"Well, ye see it took me hoosband several days to git away
wid the Spring lamb, but he foinly got trough wid the job, an'
thin Oi took the bit av skin wid the hair on, phat Oi had saved
as a guarantay av good faith, an' Oi wint down to the market.
Oi hoonted up the beautiful Dootchman, an' sez Oi:</p>

<p>"'Have you enny noice mate this mornin', Dootchy?'</p>

<p>"'Phat koind wad you loike this mornin', Mrs. Flynn?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Oi ate nothin' but the best,' sez Oi.</p>

<p>"'How wad a noice bit av Spring lamb soot?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'Tanks,' sez Oi. 'Spring lamb is a bit high-toned fer me.
Oi'll take a foine large steak av ye plaze.'</p>

<p>"'About how large?' sez he.</p>

<p>"'About tin pounds,' sez Oi, 'an' a foine juicy wan, av ye
plaze.'</p>

<p>"So Oi tuk the steak an' takin' a good grip av it, Oi slammed
it around his big Dootch ears till he yelled bloody murther in
fourteen languages. 'The nixt toime ye sell me goat fer Spring
lamb, ye thavin' Dootchman'&mdash;an' Oi kept bastin' him around
the ugly lugs&mdash;'the nixt toime ye sell me goat, Oi say, Oi'll make
ye ate his whuskers.'"</p>

<h3>Twenty-five Cents Ahead.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>A story is told about a Kingston minister's marriage fee that
causes amusement among the clergy. He was paid $1 for marrying
a couple. After they departed he was about to hand the
money to his wife, when the door bell was rung. The newly-married
wife said she wanted a certificate. No marriage was
good without one. It cost twenty-five cents for a blank that
would suit her. The reverend gentleman filled the blank out in
the usual form and she went away seemingly satisfied. A few
days later she again appeared at the door. "Mister," said the
woman in an aggrieved tone, "I looked through the papers and
can't find a notice of our wedding. You ought not to treat us
different from other folks." So the dominie went to a newspaper
office and paid fifty cents to have a notice inserted. When he
reached home he handed the remaining twenty-five cents to his
wife with the remark: "Here, my dear, hurry and take this before
that woman makes another call."</p>

<h3>Two Kinds of Bands.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>"Pap, did you ever hear music from a rubber band?" said
Johnnie.</p>

<p>"No, my son, never. What in the world do you mean. Is
it a lot of rubber figures that you blow up and then do they play
music?"</p>

<p>"Naw, pap. Come out in the next room and I'll let you hear
some music from a rubber band."</p>

<p>The old gentleman becoming interested, laid down his paper,
wiped his glasses, and followed his son into the next room, where
Johnnie had a rubber band stretched from one side of the wood
box to the other, which he began to pick with his finger. "Now,
pap, you can say that you have heard music from a rubber
band."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, "and I will be able to add that I
have caused music by a leather band," and suiting the action to
the word, he reached around for a strap, and before John knew
it he felt as if eight million rubber bands were snapping him
where his pants fit the tightest.</p>

<h3>From the Oklahoma "Snorter."</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The Oklahoma <i>Snorter</i>, in its last issue, contained the following
breezy locals:</p>

<p>Jim Highbee has secured the beautiful lot at the corner of
Bullwhacker avenue and Kill'emquick street, and has begun the
erection of a tent thereon. This lot formerly belonged to Dick
Skinner, but he gave it up at the same time he give up his life.
Col. Jim is a good shot.</p>

<p>We are glad to learn that our friend Dan Bunker has at last
come into possession of a choice lot. Dan killed the former
claimant with his first shot. Dan is a rustler, and never does
things by halves.</p>

<p>The report that the ten men found dead last night on Goosebristle
Creek had been shot, proves a fabrication. They were
the victims of congestive chills.</p>

<p>Wanted&mdash;Ten first-class grave diggers. Also, four or five
more coffin makers. Must be willing to work twelve hours a
day, but pay is large. Cophin &amp; Son.</p>

<p>Subscribers must pay for this paper in advance. Life is too
uncertain to take any chances.</p>

<p>Major Burdock, one of our gentlemanly undertakers, came up
yesterday to see us. The Major is smiling, and says he never
had more flattering business prospects. He is running a large
corps of men day and night in order to keep up with his orders.
He says he is prepared to make liberal terms with those who contemplate
taking claims, if they wish to arrange in advance for
burial.</p>

<p>There was quite a lot of freight received at the depot yesterday,
consisting chiefly of coffins and guns.</p>

<p>Notice&mdash;We are prepared to bury boomers quicker and cheaper
than any other house in the city. Send in your friends. We
will take pleasure in burying them. Plantum &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Real estate has changed hands rapidly the last few days. The
new owners usually show their liberality by burying the former
claimants.</p>

<p>Several Texans came in yesterday to locate claims. Our undertakers
are watching the corners for a good harvest.</p>

<p>Food and ammunition are becoming scarce. We learn, however,
that a carload of shot and powder is expected to-day.</p>

<p>First-class meals at all hours at Tremont hotel. Bean soup,
fifty cents a dish; eggs, ten cents each (when we have them);
water, five cents a glass. Call in second tent above the <i>Snorter</i>
office.</p>

<p>We learn that our genial friend Dick Tucker has given up his
claim and returned home. We are sorry to lose Dick, as he was
one of the most cheerful and whole-hearted men among us. If
he had known the claim was so worthless it is doubtful if he
would have shot the man who held it down before him.</p>

<p>Bill Swanson was in to-day and reported that he had secured a
fine claim just east of town. Of course he had to remove the
man who was on it, but Bill did it neatly, and then paid the funeral
expenses. There is nothing small about Bill.</p>

<p>"Martha, does thee love me?" asked a Quaker
youth of one at whose shrine his heart's fondest
feelings had been offered up. "Why, Seth," answered
she, "we are commanded to love one
another, are we not?" "Ah, Martha! but doest not
thee regard me with that feeling that the world
calls <i>love</i>?" "I hardly know what to tell thee,
Seth; I have greatly feared that my heart was an
erring one; I have tried to bestow my love on all;
but I may have sometimes thought, perhaps, that
thee was getting rather more than thy share."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Martha, my dear," said a loving husband to his
spouse, who was several years his junior, "what do
you say to moving to the far West?" "Oh, I'm
delighted with the idea! You recollect when Mr.
Morgan moved out there he was as poor as we are;
and he <i>died in three years, leaving his widow worth
a hundred thousand dollars</i>."</p>

<p>"Ma," said a juvenile grammarian, when she
returned from school; "ma, mayn't I take some of
the currant-jelly on the sideboard?" "No," said
the mother, sternly. "Well, then, ma, mayn't I
take some of the ice-cream?" "No," again replied
"ma." It was not long, however, before the young
miss was found "diggin'" into both. "Did I not
tell you," said the maternal parent, in a somewhat
angry tone, "not to touch them?" "You said <i>no</i>
twice, ma," said the precocious girl, "and the
schoolmistress says that two negatives are equal to
an affirmative; so I thought you meant that I
should eat them."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Mat, I want another <i>porter</i>." "What <i>ales</i> the
one you have, Dick?" "He's dead." "Gone to
his <i>bier</i>, eh?" "Hang you, Dick, your wit's always
a broad-<i>cider</i>."</p>

<p>"Jack, Jack!" cried a sailor, on board a ship at
sea, lately, to one of his companions.&mdash;"Hello!"
replied Jack; "what is it?"&mdash;"Your brother's overboard."&mdash;"Overboard?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"Blow
the lubber!
he has got my sea-boots and monkey-jacket
on!"</p>

<p>Judge Rooke, in going the western circuit, had a
great stone thrown at his head; but, from the circumstance
of his stooping very much, it passed over
him. "You see," said he to his friends, "that had
I been an upright judge, I might have been killed."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Kitty, where's the frying-pan?"&mdash;"Johnny's
got it, carting mud and oyster shells up the alley,
with the cat for a horse."&mdash;"The dear little fellow!
what a genius he'll yet make; but go and get it.
We're going to have company, and must fry some
fish for dinner."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>Lighting an editor's fire with rejected contributions&mdash;<i>Burns'
Justice.</i></p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>Lady F&mdash;&mdash; had arrived to so extreme a degree
of sensibility, that, seeing a man go by with a
mutilated wheelbarrow, she cried out to her companion,
"Do turn aside, it distresses me above
measure to see that poor unfortunate wheelbarrow
with one leg."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"La, me!" sighed Mrs. Muggins, "here have I
been sufferin' the begamies of death for three mortal
weeks. Fust, I was seized with a painful phrenology
in the left hampshire of the brain, which was exceeded
by a stoppage of the left ventilator of the
heart. This gave me an inflammation in the borax,
and now I'm sick with the chloroform morbus.
There is no blessin' like that of health, particularly
when you're sick."</p>

<p>"Jack," said a commercial traveller to a country
joskin, "which is the way to Harlingford?" "How
did you know my name was Jack?" inquired the
countryman. "Why, I guessed it," replied the bagman.
"Then guess your way to Harlingford," says
Jack, "for I shan't tell you."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"John, what is the past of see?" "<i>Seen</i>, sir."
"No, it is <i>saw</i>&mdash;recollect that." "Yes, sir. Then
if a <i>sea</i>-fish swims by me, it becomes a <i>saw</i>-fish when
it is <i>past</i>, and can't be <i>seen</i>." "You may go home,
John."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>Judge Peters, a Philadelphian and a punster, having
observed to another judge on the bench that
one of the witnesses had a <i>vegetable</i> head, "How
so?" was the inquiry. "He has <i>carroty</i> hair, <i>reddish</i>
cheeks, a <i>turnup</i> nose, and a <i>sage</i> look."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"John," screamed a country girl, seated by the
side of her dull lover, "leave me alone!" John,
astonished, cried, "Why, I ain't a-touching yer!"
"No," replied she, "but you might have done&mdash;if
you liked."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Jim, why is it that a musician's strains are always
heard so much less distinctly when he plays alone,
than when in a band?"&mdash;"Why, I didn't know it
was so&mdash;suppose it must be because he plays <i>so-lo</i>."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Jack," said a gentleman to an old negro, who
was rather lazily engaged in clearing the snow from
his premises, "Jack, my old boy, you don't get
along with this job very fast."&mdash;"Why, master,"
replied Jack, scratching his wool, "pretty considerable
for an old man, I guess; and I conceit myself,
that I can clear more snow away in dese here short
days, than the spryest nigga in the city could do in
the longest summer day as ever was."</p>

<p>Mr. Russell once asked a nigger to call him early
in the morning, because he wanted to go by the first
boat. "At wat time, massa?" "At half-past three
o'clock." "Half-pass tree o'clock?" "Yes, sir."
The nigger, after grinning, departed; but immediately
reappeared, saying: "Please, massa, don't
forget to ring for me at tree o'clock in the morning,
and I can be sure to wake you."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Mr. Smith, you said you once officiated in a
pulpit&mdash;do you mean by that that you preached?"
"No, sir; I held the light for a man what did."
"Ah; the court understood you differently. They
supposed that the discourse came from you." "No,
sir; I only throwed a light on it." "No levity, Mr.
Smith. Crier, wipe your nose, and call on the next
witness."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>Mrs. Hopkins told me, that she heard Green's
wife say, that John Glucks told her, that Fanny
Hopkins heard the Widow Busham say, that Captain
Weed's wife thought Colonel Hodgkins' sisters
believed, that old Miss Quint reckoned that Mrs.
Samuel Dunham had told Spoldin's wife that she
heard John Fink's daughter say, that her mother
told her, that old Miss Jenks heard Grandmother
Cook declare, that it was an undoubted fact.</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"Misther! Misther! what have you done?" said
a little fellow with protruding eyes, to a greenhorn,
who had just tied his horse to a spruce pole, as he
thought, on the street. "Done!" said the fellow,
"what do you mean? I haint been doin' nothin' as
I knows on!" "Why, yeth you have, thir; you've
hitched your hoth to the magnetic telegraph, and
you'll be in Bothton in leth than two minutes, if you
don't look out!" The man untied his horse with
nervous anxiety, and, jumping into his wagon, drove
hastily down the street.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of a barrel of cider!" said a toper
to a temperance man. "I presume not, from your
appearance; I should think a barrel of cider would
<i>run</i> at your approach," was the reply.</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"I tell you, Susan, that I will commit suicide, if
you won't have me."&mdash;"Well, John, as soon as you
have given me that proof of your affection, I will
believe that you love me."</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>If the speculator misses his aim, everybody cries
out, "He's a fool," and sometimes "He's a rogue."
If he succeeds, they besiege his door and demand
his daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>"I'm sitting on the style, Mary," as the lover
said when he seated himself on a bonnet of the
latest Paris fashion.</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"If you say another crooked word I'll knock
your brains out," said a blacksmith to his termagant
wife. "Ram's horns, you dog!" exclaimed his
hopeful helpmate, "ram's horns, if I die for it!"</p>

<p>It is said there is a man in Connecticut who walks
so fast, that it puts his shadow out of breath to keep
up with him.</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>In the course of the Irish state trial, Mr. Whiteside
quoted an extraordinary figure once used by
an advocate: "I smell a rat&mdash;I see it brewing in
the storm&mdash;and I will crush it in the bud!"</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>"I say, Pat, what are you writing there in such a
large hand?" "Array, honey, an' isn't it to my
poor mother, who is very deaf, that I'm writing
a loud letther?"</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>I think it is a very foolish thing for any man to
become a <i>sleeping</i> partner, because he may <i>awake</i>
and find himself in the Gazette.</p>

<p>"Dad," said an incipient legislator to his indulgent
parent, who had gratified him with a visit to
the galleries of the capital, "say do you see any
row going on? I don't." "No," said the astonished
father, "of course not. Why did you ask?" "Cause
the man in the big desk says&mdash;'the <i>eyes</i> have it!'&mdash;and
just now he said the <i>nose</i> had it&mdash;so I thought
there was some <i>fun</i> down there some'ers!"</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>During a learned lecture by a German adventurer,
one Baron Vondullbrains, he illustrated the glory
of mechanics, as a science, thus:&mdash;"De t'ing dat is
<i>made</i> is more superior dan de <i>maker</i>, I shall show
you how in some t'ings. Suppose I make de round
wheel of de coach? Ver' well; dat wheel roll round
five hundred mile!&mdash;and I cannot roll one myself!
Suppose I am a cooper, what you call, and I make
de big tub to hold wine? He hold tons and
gallons; and <i>I cannot hold more dan five bottle</i>!
So you see dat what is made is more superior dan
de maker."</p>

<p>"Doctor, that ere ratsbane of yourn is fust rate,"
said a Yankee to a village apothecary.&mdash;"Know'd
it," said the pleased vendor of drugs. "Don't keep
nothing but first-rate doctor's stuff."&mdash;"And, doctor,"
said the joker, coolly, "I want to buy another
pound of ye."&mdash;"Another pound?"&mdash;"Yes, sir; I
gin that pound I bought the other day to a nibbling
mouse, and it made him dreadful sick, and I am
sure another pound would kill him!"</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>Drunken Davy, after spending his day's earnings
at a grocery, set out for home. "Well," says he,
"if I find my wife up, I'll kick her&mdash;what business
has she to sit up, wasting fire and light, eh? And
if I find her in bed, I'll kick her&mdash;what business has
she to go to bed before I get home?"</p>
